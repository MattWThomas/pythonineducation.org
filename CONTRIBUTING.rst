Contributing to pythonineducation.org
-------------------------------------

Hey! Many thanks for wanting to improve http://pythonineducation.org/.

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from *anyone* irrespective of
who you are. If you're thinking, "but they probably don't mean me" then WE
ESPECIALLY MEAN YOU! Good quality code and engagement with respect, humour and
intelligence wins every time.

* If you're from a background which isn't well-represented in most geeky
  groups, get involved - *we want to help you make a difference*.
* If you're from a background which *is* well-represented in most geeky groups,
  get involved - *we want your help making a difference*.
* If you're worried about not being technical enough, get involved -
  *your fresh perspective will be invaluable*.
* If you think you're an imposter, get involved.
* If your day job isn't code, get involved.
* This isn't a group of experts, we're a community. Get involved!
* We are interested in educational, social and technical problems. If you are
  too, get involved.
* *No-one knows what they are doing*, so help out and (you guessed it) get
  involved.

We expect contributors to follow the Python in Education Community Code of Conduct. Please read the code of conduct file in the repo. 

Feedback may be given for contributions and, where necessary, changes will
be politely requested and discussed with the originating author. Respectful
yet robust argument is most welcome.
